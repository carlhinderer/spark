------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Unmasking Hacker Communications

    - Given any hacker string, we’ll want to do the following:

        - Replace all the 7s with t’s.
        - Replace all the 3s with e’s.
        - Replace all the 4s with a’s.
        - Replace all the 6s with g’s.
        - Replace all the Chinese characters with spaces.


    - Creating helper functions

        # Helper Functions

        def replace_7t(s):
            return s.replace('7','t')
        def replace_3e(s):
            return s.replace('3','e')
        def replace_6g(s):
            return s.replace('6','g')
        def replace_4a(s):
            return s.replace('4'.,'a')


        # Chinese character matcher, in class to store compiled regex

        import re

        class ChineseMatcher:
        
            def __init__(self):
                self.r = re.compile(r'[\u4e00-\u9fff]+')
        
            def sub_chinese(self,s):
                return self.r.sub(s, " ") 


    - Creating a pipeline

        - 3 Ways to chain helper functions together:

            1. Use a sequence of maps
            2. Chain functions together using compose
            3. Create a function pipeline with 'pipe'


        - The compose and pipe functions are provided in the toolz library.

            $ pip install toolz



- Twitter Demographic Projections

    - Here, we get a list of tweet idents for each user, and we want to try and predict the
        gender of the Twitter user.  We will need to:

        - Retrieve the tweets represented by those IDs
        - Extract the tweet text from those tweets
        - Tokenize the extracted text
        - Score the tokens
        - Score users based on their tweet scores
        - Categorize the users based on their score


    - In order to interact with Twitter, we'll need to:

        1. Install the python-twitter package.

             $ pip install python-twitter

        2. Sign up for a Twitter developer account.

        3. Create a new 'app' in the Twitter developer console.


    - Tweet-level pipeline

    - User-level pipeline

    - Applying the pipeline
