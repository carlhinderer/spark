- Why Large Datasets?

    3 Sizes of Large Dataset Problems

      1. Data can both fit and be processed on a PC
           (We know how to solve these)
  
      2. The solution can be executed from a PC, but the data can't be stored on a PC
           (Needs parallel computing)
  
      3. The solution can't be executed or stored on a PC
           (Needs distributed computing)



- Parallel Computing

    - Understanding parallel computing

    - Scalable computing with the map and reduce style

    - When to use this style



- The Map and Reduce Style

    - The map function for transforming data

    - The reduce function for advanced transformations

    - Map and reduce for data transformation pipelines



- Distributed computing for speed and scale


- Hadoop


- Spark


- AWS EMR
