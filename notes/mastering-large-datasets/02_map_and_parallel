------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Introduction to Map

    - 3 primary capabilities of map

        - We can use it to replace for loops.
        - We can use it to transform data.
        - Map evaluates only when necessary, not when called.


    - The power of lazy functions (like map) for large datasets

        When moving from Python2 to Python3, the 'range' function was made lazy.  This was
          so that huge ranges could be created without:

          1. Taking the time to generate a massive list of numbers
          2. Storing all the values in memory when we may only need a few
