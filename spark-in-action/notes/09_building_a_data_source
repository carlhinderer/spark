- Building Your Own Data Source

    - Let's say you are working with a company and you want to ingest some data sources:

        1. An ERP's REST API
        2. A CNC Router in a workshop
        3. DICOM files (with medical metadata) from an X-ray machine

      This might sound like a strange combination, but data scientists will find 
        correlations in strange places.


    - Now, you could build separate applications to pull this data and put it in CSV or JSON
        files.  However, you'll have to maintain files.  You'll have to worry about retention
        policies and access controls.


    - Instead, you could just build Spark extensions that talk to each of the devices, and
        then you wouldn't have to worry about any of these things.



- EXIF

    - When cameras take pictures and store them in flash memory, they typically store them 
        as JPEGs.  The JPEGs can contain metadata in a format called 'EXIF' (Exchange Image
        File Format).


    - To read EXIF data, we'll use an open source library called 'Metadata Extractor'.  We'll
        insert this library into our 'pom.xml'.
