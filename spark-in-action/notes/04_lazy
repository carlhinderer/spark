- Transformations and Actions

    - We've typically been ending most examples with the 'show()' method, which is good
        for debugging, but isn't the typical end goal.


    - The 'collect()' method is used more often in the real world.  It allows you to
        retrieve the entire DataFrame in your native language.


    - In our lab for this chapter, we'll perform 3 experiments:

        1. Load a dataset and perform a collection action.

        2. Load a dataset, perform a transformation, then perform a collection action.

        3. Load a dataset, perform a transformation, drop a column, then perform a
             collection action.  This will illustrate Spark's laziness.



- We'll look at a dataset of teen birth rates in each county in the US.  These are the
    columns in the dataset:


    Column name in dataset    Type        Comment
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Year                       Numeric
    State                      String
    County                     String
    State FIPS Code            Integer     State code in US Federal Information Processing Standards
    County FIPS Code           Integer     County code in the US FIPS
    Combined FIPS Code         Integer     Combination of the state and county FIPS code in one
    Birth Rate                 Decimal     Births per 1,000 females ages 15â€“19 in a given year
    Lower Confidence Limit     Decimal     Column renamed lcl later
    Upper Confidence Limit     Decimal     Column renamed ucl later


    - This dataset contains lower and upper confidence limits. Confidence limits are the numbers 
        at the upper and lower end of a confidence interval.
